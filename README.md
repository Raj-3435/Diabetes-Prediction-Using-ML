# Diabetes Prediction Using ML

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting diabetes using the PIMA Diabetes dataset. The project focuses on data preprocessing, feature scaling, and training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict diabetes based on given health parameters.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **PIMA Diabetes Dataset**, which consists of medical diagnostic features collected from patients. The key features include:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function score
- **Age**: Age of the patient (years)
- **Outcome**: Class label (1: Diabetic, 0: Non-Diabetic)

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data handling)
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
- **Scikit-Learn** (for machine learning models and evaluation)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration**: Statistical analysis and data distribution checks are performed.
3. **Preprocessing & Standardization**: Features are standardized using `StandardScaler`.
4. **Model Training**: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on the processed data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The accuracy of the model is calculated to assess performance.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML.git
2. Navigate the project directory
   ```sh
   cd Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML

3. Install dependencies
4. Run the jupyter notebook or google colab to execute the model

## Results

- The model is trained and tested using a split dataset.
- Performance is measured using accuracy metrics.
- Further improvements can be made by tuning hyperparameters or using deep learning models.
